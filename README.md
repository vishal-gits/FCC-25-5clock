### Project Description - Build a 25+5Clock(Pomodoro Clock)

Pomodoro Clock is a timer based on Pomodoro Technique. Its a effective time management tool. A goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.

    1.Decide on the task to be done.

    2.Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).

    3.Work on the task.

    4.End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).

    5.Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.

    6.After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
